# Simple Calculator
This is the calculator I created for the job recruitment.
	
## Technologies
To create it I used my favorite JavaScript library that is **React**.
I also used **Sass** to help me create the visual part.

## In the process of creating
When creating the application, I paid attention to both view and functionality. On the basis of the ready design, I created the entire visual design and then proceeded to implement its functionality. I tried to pay attention to the smallest details, such as the sequence of actions in the operation hint placed above the result, thanks to which, where necessary, parentheses are automatically added and removed. Besides, I implemented the necessary logic to prevent actions such as division by 0.
